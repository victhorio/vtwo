# V2

If my notes are my second brain, then an AI powered by my notes is a second Victhor.

**This is an early development repo.** For now it's just an idea and for the near future it will be incomplete drafts while I explore them.

The fundamental idea however is to create a system that "connects" local Markdown (Obsidian) notes to an LLM to provide a copilot through a CLI.

Basic ideas:
- command line REPL to interact with the LLM
- use a remote LLM for the near future (maybe migrate to a local one eventually for privacy)
- embedding RAG of note blocks
- relies on specific structure of the nodes (header 3 blocks with semantic meanings)
- purely intented to serve my own necessities/interests
